# 4-tap-16-bit-unsigned-averaging-FIR-filter
This is the final project for the UCSD ECE 260A course. We aimed to design a high-performance 4-tap 16-bit unsigned averaging FIR filter. The project is implemented in SystemVerilog, verified through ModelSim simulation, and synthesized for 65nm CMOS technology.
